Plagueis, the legend went, was so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life, and even saved others from dying. He became so powerful, the only thing that he was afraid of was losing his power. His apprentice Darth Sidious recalled. In the end, Sidious, though unnamed by Palpatine in his recounting of the story to Anakinâ€”killed him in his sleep. According to Palpatine, what made it a tragedy was the irony that he could not save himself from his death, despite being able to save others. When Palpatine told this story to Skywalker, Skywalker countered that it was only a tragedy for Plagueis, and for the apprentice it was a happy ending. Palpatine later revealed that he was the unnamed apprentice, and that Plagueis' ability had been real. This was one of the steps towards turning Skywalker to the dark side of the Force.")
